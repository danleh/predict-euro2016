    % Typically, for "tip games" or bets you will still get some points
    % (albeit lesser) if you at least have the goal difference or the
    % winning team correct, even if you guessed the goal count wrong.

    % but rather the expected value of the betting game.
    
    % In my case, you get 4 points for the exact result, 2 points for the 
    % correct winning team (or draw), and 3 points for the correct goal 
    % difference (if the game was not a draw, otherwise you get just 2 points).
