# Predicting the UEFA Euro 2016 Championship Results
This is a crude attempt at predicting the results of individual games of the group stage of the European soccer championships 2016. 

## Basic Idea

1. Obtain some kind of "rating" or "strength factor" for each participating national team. This could be an Elo number (e.g. the [World Football Elo Ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings) from [this website](http://www.eloratings.net/world.html) or some otherwise comparable number, e.g. the [FIFA/Coca-Cola World Rating](http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html) for national soccer teams.
2. Learn from past games of two competing teams how their "Elo number" affects the final score of their game. Formally speaking, we want to learn a function of 2 numbers to 2 other numbers, i.e. a mapping ```f: R^2 -> R^2```. This is a prime candidate for simple machine learning methods.

  + The first article I read about the topic. Attempts to predict outcomes for the soccer world cup 2014. Basis of my assumption that the number of goals per match is approximately Poisson-distributed. Interesting assessment of home advantage. Also talks about the knock-out tree.

  + Tries to predict 2013/2014 English Premier League results based on training data from the previous season. Additional evidence for the Poisson-distribution hypothesis. Very interesting idea of "offensive" and "defensive" score per team. Quite high accuracy (to my understanding): 58% correct outcome (who wins), 8% correct exact result (goals scored).

  + Actually read that after my implementation. Seems to use a very similar model :). Nice links for further reading.

## Ideas for Improvement, Unsubstantiated Assumptions, Questions, TODOs

- Is the relation between rating and scored goals linear at all?
- Idea: Use more features to describe a national team. 
  + Higgins et al. (see above) use an "offensive" vs. "defensive" score for each team in their prediction of the 2013/14 English Premier League season outcomes.
  + Identify each team with its "set of players". Good: Could potentially use a lot more data from national/club league matches. Problem: Is a team really only as strong as the sum of its players? How much influence does the trainer and his/her staff have?
  + Problem: Overfitting (see next point)
- Problem: For international matches there are not many datapoints. E.g. the German national team had only about 10 matches in 2015. How do we prevent overfitting if we have only ~20 data points over 2 years?
- Problem: The squad changes considerably over time, so results from 2010 are probably not very relevant for predictions in 2016. 
- Problem: The same applies to individual players. How constant is their "value" over time?
- Improvement: I assumed the _current_ Elo when learning on _past_ matches. This is of course bogus. One would have to take the Elo number at the time of the match. Problem: I do not know a source for old Elo numbers...
